# This is a test action. Unless you've blindly copied and pasted it elsewhere,
# it's in the cals_test_repo repo. All it does is call
# calevans/action-see-me@master and then demponstrates how to run another
# command with the run: directive.

    # Steps is an array I've started each step with a name but that's not
    # necessary, it just makes it easier to read.
    # Each step runs as it's own process. If you look closely at the output of
    # the first step, you'll see the three environment variables defined
    # displayed. If you look at the output of the $_SERVER variable, you won't
    # see them there.
